# RGBLightController
This is the first iteration of a the UI Design, once we have a program up and running I can add more and we can work on integrating the javaFX libraries into our main program so we can integrate it.
Currently the ui is only a color picker that outputs hex values so we will need to learn how to use hex values to display a color output on pi4j
